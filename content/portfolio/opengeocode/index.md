## Objective 

A geocode operation is a process to translate a geographic entity in a code. 

For example, we want to translate this french address : 

    Route du Tr√©port 80230 Saint-Valery-sur-Somme
    
Into geographic coordinate, longitude and latitude : 

    47,0.504549603611111 0.7787510938888894
    
## Issue 

When the address is misspelled or contain error, it's much more difficult to find coordinate. 
You may also want to transform address into linear values in order to use it in another machine learning process.

With our previous exemple, it could be something like that: 

    Rte du trepot saint-valery / somme
    
## NGrams, TF-IDF, MiniBatchKMeans and Approximate Nearest Neighbor

In our case we will use trigrams of characters to solve misspelling address and more generally robustifying 
the search index.  
`computer` will be translate in `com`, `omp`, `mpu`, `put`, `ute`, `ter`

TFIDF on ngrams will allow to select most relevant ngrams. In our case, the size of the vocabulary will be 5000
and the tfidf threshold 0.2

Since we are using high dimensional and sparce vectors, we will reduce dimension with [MiniBatchKMeans](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning.html#sklearn.decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning) 

Lastly, we will use the efficient implementation on AAN [Annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy) to index them
