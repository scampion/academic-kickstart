In this training, student will discover various machine learning algorithms (supervised, unsupervised) apply to 
different formats text, image, sound or video.

- Texts classification with Bayesian network in Java
- Pictures a texts classification with the `bag of words` based on k-means, PCA for reduction dimention and SVM
- Speech music and silent classifier with KNN and cepstral coefficients as features
- Real time face recogniton in video with OpenCV and Haar Cascade
